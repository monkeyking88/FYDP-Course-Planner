why is it a np problem?

it is a set problem that has lots of different possiblities

we have a bunch of buckets that we have to fill and can be filled by multiple items

think of Knowledge integration with several possibilities

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Double Counting (Best Example so far)

the double counting problem can be seen as a more complicated version of 
the NPC problem - set packing
http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~algorith/files/set-packing.shtml
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_packing

Let Mike be a student.
Let U be the set of all courses that Mike has taken, 
	each course in U is assigned with a positive integer l, which indicates the upper limit on the number of requirements that the course can be used to count towards to.

Let R1, R2, ... , Rn be sets of subsets of S, where
	each element in Ri is a subset of Mike's courses that is valid to be used to satisfy Requirement Ri.

Let R_All = {R1, R2, ..., Rn}

Let R_Union = R1 U R2 U ... U Rn.
Does there exist a subset of n elements in R_Union s.t. each element of the subset belongs to a distinct member in R_All and each course c is not used in more than c.l requirements. 


The set packing problem:
Given a set U, a set of subsets of U, called it S, and a integer k.
Does there exist a subset of S, called it C s.t. all elements in C are pairwise disjoint and |C|>=k.


Reduction:
Given inputs of a set packing problem: U, S, k
Assign each element in U with integer 1.
Let there be k requirements s.t. S=R1=R2=...=Rk.

A Potential Situation:

Need 1.5 units of ECON courses with 65% to get a minor

Course		Unit	Grade
ECON 100	0.20	70%
ECON 101	0.10	60%
ECON 102	0.25	60%
ECON 103	0.5	60%
ECON 104	0.5	60%
ECON 105	0.20	70%
ECON 106	0.5	65%

0/1 knapsack problem

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

A real life scenario (don't use it):

"
Honours Mathematical Economics
Continuation in this academic plan requires a cumulative average of 60%, a cumulative Economics average of 75%, and a cumulative Mathematics average of 60%. Both regular and co-operative versions of this plan are available.

Economics Plan-level requirements:
at least seven academic course units (14 courses) in Economics with a minimum cumulative average of 75%, including:
ECON 101, ECON 102, ECON 201, ECON 202, ECON 301, ECON 302, ECON 371, ECON 401, ECON 402, ECON 421, ECON 472
three additional ECON courses at the 300-level or above

...

1. Students must achieve a cumulative average of at least 75% in the 14 economics courses counted towards the degree and a cumulative average of 60% in the 13 math courses counted towards the degree.

Directly quoted from https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/ARTS-Honours-Mathematical-Economics

Suppose a student has taken the 11 required ECON courses of Mathematical Economics with an average of exactly 75%
ECON 101, ECON 102, ECON 201, ECON 202, ECON 301, ECON 302, ECON 371, ECON 401, ECON 402, ECON 421, ECON 472

But the student also needs 3 more ECON courses to graduate

The student has also taken
ECON 311
ECON 321
ECON 332
ECON 341
ECON 342
