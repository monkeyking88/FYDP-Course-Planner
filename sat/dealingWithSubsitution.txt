subsitution
-if we have a subsitution done by the prof (e.g CS350 instead of SE 350)
-then we look for say the instance of CS350 and replace it for SE350 in the trasncript
 before sending it over to alloy
-if CS350 not found then no chagnes



Note: that it takes care of having two courses in extra list
